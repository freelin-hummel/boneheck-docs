## **Consolidated AD\&D 2e Supplemental Weapon Table with Estimated HM5e Speed**

The following table integrates weapons from the AD\&D 2nd Edition *Player's Handbook* (PHB) with additional arms sourced from various supplements. Each entry includes its cost in gold pieces (gp), weight in pounds (lbs.), size (T=Tiny, S=Small, M=Medium, L=Large, G=Gargantuan), type (P=Piercing, S=Slashing, B=Bludgeoning), Speed Factor (SF), estimated HackMaster 5e style speed in seconds (Est. HM5e Speed (s)) based on SF, damage against Small-Medium (S-M) and Large (L) opponents, and range increments in yards (Y) or feet (') where applicable. The source abbreviation indicates the supplement where the weapon statistics were primarily found or compiled from.1

## **Notes on Supplemental Weapons & Data**

This compilation significantly expands the arsenal available beyond the standard AD\&D 2nd Edition *Player's Handbook*. The following notes provide context on the sources used, highlight notable weapon categories, clarify statistical meanings, and offer observations on the diversity of the 2e weapon list.

### **A. Source and Scope Clarifications**

* **Book of Artifacts (BoA):** A review of materials related to the *Book of Artifacts* (TSR 2138\) confirmed its focus on unique, powerful items with significant lore and magical properties, often tied to specific campaign narratives.3 These items fit the definition of artifacts rather than standard equipment. Consequently, no standard, generally usable weapons suitable for this comparative list were identified within the BoA. The distinction between common arms and campaign-altering artifacts is crucial; BoA deals exclusively with the latter.  
* **Arms & Equipment Guide (A\&EG):** The 2nd Edition *Arms and Equipment Guide* (TSR 2123\) is a recognized source for expanding the standard equipment lists. While reviewed conceptually, specific weapon data in the table above primarily relies on the comprehensive compilation found in 1, which draws from numerous official sources. A\&EG remains a valuable resource for detailed descriptions and illustrations, though direct stat extraction for this table was superseded by the more integrated data source. Users should be aware that other editions or related materials sometimes share the "Arms and Equipment" title, potentially leading to confusion if not referencing the specific 2e volume.  
* **PHBR Series & Campaign Settings:** The Player's Handbook Rules Supplement (PHBR) series and various campaign setting books were significant contributors to this expanded list. Weapons were sourced from PHBR1 (*The Complete Fighter's Handbook*), PHBR2 (*The Complete Thief's Handbook*), PHBR6 (*The Complete Book of Dwarves*), PHBR8 (*The Complete Book of Elves*), PHBR10 (*The Complete Book of Humanoids*), and PHBR11 (*The Complete Ranger's Handbook*). Setting-specific weapons were drawn from *Forgotten Realms Adventures* (FRA), *Al-Qadim*, *Dark Sun* core materials, and *The Complete Gladiator's Handbook* (CGR2) for Dark Sun. These supplements often introduced weapons tied to specific cultures, professions, or environments.1  
* **Extra-Source Inclusion (Dragon/Polyhedron):** For maximum utility, this table includes weapons whose statistics were compiled in the reference source 1 but originated in official TSR periodicals like *Dragon Magazine* (indicated by "Dra \#") or *Polyhedron Magazine* (indicated by "Poly \#"). While these magazines fall outside the specific book-based archive scope requested, their inclusion provides a more complete picture of the weaponry available during the AD\&D 2nd Edition era. Their sources are clearly marked to distinguish them from the core supplements. Omitting them would render the table less comprehensive than other commonly available 2e resources.

### **B. Notable Weapon Categories**

* **Firearms (Forgotten Realms):** *Forgotten Realms Adventures* (FRA) formally introduced gunpowder weapons into that setting, including the Pistol, Blunderbuss, Musket, and Caliver, alongside the PHB's Arquebus. These weapons often feature unique mechanics. For instance, early rules suggested firearms might use "exploding damage dice" (where maximum rolls allow additional dice to be rolled) or have specific misfire chances.10 The stats presented here reflect the compiled data , but players using firearms should consult FRA for the full rules regarding their operation, ammunition (smokepowder and shot), and potential drawbacks. Note the Blunderbuss and Pistol stats listed here differ from those in the PHB Arquebus entry.  
* **Non-Metal Weapons (Dark Sun):** The harsh world of Athas (Dark Sun setting) features scarce metal, leading to weapons commonly crafted from bone, stone, wood, obsidian, or chitin. Such materials typically impose a \-1 penalty on attack and damage rolls compared to their metal counterparts. The economy also reflects this scarcity, making even basic metal items extremely expensive. The table includes several weapons explicitly sourced from Dark Sun (Chatkcha, Impaler, Quabone, Talid, Wrist Razor, Gythka, Hamanu's Staff, Mandible Sword) and CGR2 (*The Complete Gladiator's Handbook* \- Alhulak, Carrikal, Dejada, Lotulis, Puchik, Singing Sticks, Trikal). Other weapons like the Bone Dagger or Stone Spear, while potentially found elsewhere, are particularly characteristic of the Athasian environment.1  
* **Cultural/Exotic Arms (Al-Qadim, PHBRs):** Supplements introduced weapons reflecting specific cultural or professional themes. *Al-Qadim* provided arms suited to its Arabian Adventures setting, such as the Ankus, Bagh Nakh, Jambiya, Katar, Razor, Scythe, Garotte, Scourge, and Great Scimitar. PHBR books introduced weapons associated with specific kits or professions, like the Samurai's Katana and Wakizashi (from PHBR1) or the Pirate's Cutlass and Belaying Pin (also PHBR1).

### **C. Understanding Weapon Statistics**

* **Speed Factor (SF):** This number represents a weapon's relative quickness in combat. It primarily functions within the AD\&D 2e initiative system, acting as a modifier to the initiative roll (d10) and as a crucial tie-breaker. Lower Speed Factors indicate faster weapons, which generally act earlier in a round. Significantly faster weapons (often defined as having a Speed Factor half that of the opponent, or lower by 5 or more) could potentially grant multiple attacks against a slower opponent under specific initiative conditions (like tied rolls). The full initiative mechanics are detailed in the *Player's Handbook* and *Dungeon Master's Guide*; the Speed Factor listed here is one component of that system.  
* **Size & Type:** Weapon Size (Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Gargantuan) influences usability by different character sizes and sometimes affects damage against certain opponents (though the primary damage difference is captured in the Dmg S-M vs. Dmg L columns). Weapon Type (Piercing, Slashing, Bludgeoning) is critical for determining effectiveness against certain armors (using optional rules), overcoming damage resistance, and adhering to class restrictions (e.g., Clerics are often restricted from using edged weapons, favoring Bludgeoning types). Some weapons possess multiple damage types (e.g., P/S, P/B, S/B, P/S/B), offering versatility.1  
* **Range:** For missile weapons (bows, crossbows, slings) and thrown weapons (daggers, axes, spears, etc.), range is presented in increments for Short/Medium/Long distances. Attacks at Medium range typically incur a \-2 penalty to hit, while Long range attacks suffer a \-5 penalty. Short range attacks receive no penalty. Note that bows and slings typically measure range in yards (Y), while thrown weapons use feet (').

### **D. Observations on Weapon Variety**

* **Redundancy and Niche Protection:** The AD\&D 2nd Edition weapon list, particularly when expanded by supplements, features a vast number of options. However, observers have noted that many weapons, especially within categories like polearms or swords, possess very similar statistics. This can lead to situations where some weapons are mechanically superior or inferior to others in most circumstances, creating potential "false choices" for players optimizing for combat effectiveness.  
* **Weapon Groups (Optional Rule):** Recognizing the granularity and potential redundancy of the weapon list, *The Complete Fighter's Handbook* (PHBR1) introduced the optional Weapon Group Proficiency system. Instead of requiring a separate proficiency slot for every individual weapon (e.g., Long Sword, Broad Sword, Scimitar), this system allows characters (especially Warriors) to gain proficiency in broader categories like "Heavy Blades," "Axes," or "Polearms".11 This simplifies proficiency management and makes less common weapons within a group more accessible if a character is proficient in the group. While this is an optional rule and doesn't alter the base statistics presented in the table, it offers a valuable mechanism for handling the extensive weapon variety within a campaign.
